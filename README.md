# The Irrationality of Pi (Made in p5.js)
### A visualization for the irrationality of pi by rendering r(θ) = e^θi + e^πθi using 2 pendulums and demonstrating pi's irrationality through the fact that the pendulum never repeats the same path.

Here's an image of the program (you can control the speed with your scroll wheel):
